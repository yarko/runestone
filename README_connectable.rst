connectable.us alternative to edx
=================================

These are some of my initial notes:

* use without web2py;
* rewrite assessments in either coffeescript or pythonium;
* extend assessments for sentences, concepts;
* replace js with dart & polymer;
* replace css with sass-lang.com;
* replace web2py with go equivalent (or flask, initially);
* add forum discussions;
* replace jinja2 in sphinx w/ mako (get python-ish, closer to edx);
* add forum discussions, ala edX, BUT:
  * insert discussion threads in context (also);
* add "help"
* add slide links;
* authenticate for access;
